      "      naturally occurring compounds produced by all prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells that \n",

      "      literature was reviewed for investigations that were relevant to infections commonly \n",
      "      seen by surgeons and the potential applicability of AMPs for surgical care. RESULTS: \n",
      "      Antimicrobial peptides are low-molecular-weight peptides with activity against \n",
      "      bacteria, fungi, and viruses. Experimental evidence shows that AMPs have activity \n",
